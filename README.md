# TypeRacer
This is a program allowing students to practice their typing and race against the clock. The target audience is students who are learning to type, and students who want to strengthen their typing skills.

# Motivation
We wanted to create software that has a real educational impact while being fun and practical. By gamifying typing practice, and allowing for students and teachers to add their own blocks of educational text to practice with, we've created a product that fits our goal by providing a fun and practical approach to mastering typing and learning educational concepts simultaneously.
